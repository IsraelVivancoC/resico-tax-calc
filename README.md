# RESICO Tax Calculator (Java)

Educational Java project focused on practicing clean code and object-oriented design.

## Purpose
This project explores how a simple tax calculation can evolve into a clean and extensible design using core Java concepts.

This version focuses on **modeling tax rules as domain objects** instead of hard-coded conditionals.

## Current Approach (v0.2)
- Strategy pattern via `TaxCalculator`
- Business rules represented as `TaxBracket` objects
- No conditional chains for tax rates
- Clear separation of responsibilities

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Clean Code
- Domain modeling

## How to Run
Compile and run `Main.java`.

## Notes
This project is iterative by design. Future versions will refine and extend the current approach.
